# UnsupNAS-toolkit
UnsupNAS stands for Unsupervised Representation of Architectures for Neural Architetcure Search. This the topic for my RnD project under Prof. Abir De*. This repository is not official, and the files found here are not the complete project, though I'll add them here soon enough.

matrix_to_network.py converts adjacency matrices of cells** to fully trainable CNNs. train.py is the driver code to train these networks. Have a look at the command line arguments of train.py before running it.
